            My hobbies include anything that involve making things. Be it phsyical or digital, I like to act of putting things together.
            I have a handful of Gunpla figures on my shelf, as well as other miscellaneous buildables.

            I'm a big gamer, and I recently finished getting all the achievements for <i>Control</i>. I enjoy action and horror games mostly,
            with <i>Dead by Daylight</i> being the main game I come back to.

            I've recently gotten back into reading, and it's been great. I just finished reading Neil Gaiman's <i>Neverwhere,</i> and now I'm starting another one of his books, <i>Anansi Boys.</i>
            My goal is to get through all the dusty books I have on my bookshelf.

            One of my favorite hobbies that I'm trying to get back into is art. I've participated in the monthly art challenge of Inktober regularly, where you create an inked
            drawing for every day of the month. You can check that out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xealstrag/">here</a>. I've mostly done traditional art, but I would like to transition to doing more digital art.
